"Raspberry Pi Pico is a microcontroller that you can use in your embedded "
"system projects, prototyping. Raspberry Pi Pico, powered by the ``RP2040 "
"microcontroller``, has a dual-core ARM Cortex M0+ processor. The low-cost"
" Raspberry Pi Pico stands out with its low power consumption and high "
"performance. The Raspberry Pi Pico, which can be programmed with both "
"C/C++ and MicroPython, appeals to users of all ages."

msgid ""
"It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the "
"surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin. It's "
"fairly simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data."

"Light emitting diode (LED) modules are self-contained devices that "
"contain a chain of LED emitters. Owing to their size, small LED modules "
"make perfect light fixtures in narrow profiles and applications where "
"space is limited."

"RGB LED modules can emit various colors of light. The three primary "
"colors, red, green, and blue, can be mixed and compose all kinds of "
"colors by brightness, so you can make an RGB LED emit colorful light by "
"controlling the circuit."

"LDR sensor module is used to detect the intensity of light. When there is"
" light, the resistance of LDR will become low according to the intensity "
"of light. The greater the intensity of light, the lower the resistance of"
" LDR. The sensor has a potentiometer knob that can be adjusted to change "
"the sensitivity of LDR towards light."
