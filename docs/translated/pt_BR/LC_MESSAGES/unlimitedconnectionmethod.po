"With Picobricks, you can build your circuits without cable clutter. "
"Similarly, you can get rid of code confusion by coding with the "
"Microbloks program. With this feature, we eliminate many problems that we"
" may encounter when starting an ordinary robotic coding education lesson,"
" thanks to the modular structure of the Picobricks. After entering the "
"robotic coding training, we have the opportunity to do more projects by "
"breaking the modules on the Picobricks from the necessary places and "
"connecting the modules to the Raspberry Pi Pico with **Groove Cables.**"
