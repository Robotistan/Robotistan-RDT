"Pico Bricks is an electronic development ``board + software`` which is "
"designed for use in maker projects. With ten detachable modules included,"
" Pico Bricks can be used to create a wide variety of projects. It also "
"includes a protoboard that you can use to add your own modules! Pico "
"Bricks is for everyone interested in electronics and coding. Beginners "
"with no prior experience will find it easy to get started thanks to the "
"modular hardware design, Scratch-like block coding environment, and "
"simulator. Those with experience can dig more deeply into electronics or "
"explore coding in Python. And even the most expert makers will appreciate"
" how quickly they can explore ideas and create prototypes with Pico "
"Bricks. Unlike other boards, Pico Bricks has an incredible amount of "
"flexibility for every level of makers! Bricks IDE has example code for "
"different scenarios."

"Once you've explored the Pico Bricks modules, you may want to use some of"
" them in a project. Although Pico Bricks is compact, there's no need to "
"build the entire thing into your project. By detaching the Pico Bricks "
"modules, you can connect just the modules you need using cables with "
"standard, easy-to-use Grove connectors."
