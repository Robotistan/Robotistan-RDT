Rock-Paper-Scissor
###########

Introduction
-------------
In this project, we will build a simple electronic rock-paper-scissors game by using Picobricks.

Project Details and Algorithm
------------------------------
This project is perfect for beginners, as it only requires a few components. While both the wiring diagram and the associated software are easy to understand.

RULES:

- Scissors cuts Paper

- Paper covers Rock

- Rock crushes Scissors

How could you make this nicer?

Think about :

- Add a bigger button

- Add a bigger OLED screen

- Use images instead of text

- Using a 3D printed arrow and board.

Use your imagination...
